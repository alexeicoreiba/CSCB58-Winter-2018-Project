# CSCB58-Winter-2018-Project: Its raining Doppler bills 
This is the repository for the our CSCB58 or Computer Organization course at the University of Toronto Scarborough. 

Our project will consist of our DE2 Board connected to a depth sensor, the HC-SR04, as well as a very small buzzer through the board GPIO pins. 

As per our original project proposal, our code will connect the depth sensor and the buzzer, and output a continuous beeping sound based on the distance that the depth sensor "senses". Thus, when we move our hand back and forth in front of it, it'll seem just like the original physical doppler effect in real life, as when it comes closer the pitch goes higher than when the distance is far. 

All code is in verilog.
